11 Types of Variables in a Dataset!

Beyond features and targets, datasets include various variable types essential for analysis.

1-2) Independent and Dependent Variables

Independent Variables: Inputs used to predict outcomes.
Dependent Variable: The outcome being predicted.

3) Interaction Variables

Capture combined effects of two or more variables, often in regression analysis.

4) Latent Variables

Not directly observed but inferred from other variables.
Example: In clustering, true labels are latent variables inferred from data.

5-7) Confounding, Correlated, and Control Variables

Confounding Variables: Affect both independent and dependent variables, potentially biasing results.
Example: Temperature influences both ice cream and air conditioner sales.
Control Variables: Accounted for to eliminate bias from confounders.

8) Leaky Variables

Unintentionally reveal information about the target not available at prediction time.

9-10) Stationary and Non-Stationary Variables

Stationary Variables: Statistical properties remain constant over time.
Important because many models assume identical distributions.
Non-Stationary Variables: Statistical properties change over time.
Tip: Use relative changes (Î”P/P) instead of absolute values to handle non-stationarity.

11) Lagged Variables

Previous values used to predict future values.
Example: Using last month's sales to predict next month's sales.
