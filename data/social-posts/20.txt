Pandas is getting outdated.

5 reasons you should move to FireDucks.

1. Requires changing ONLY ONE line of code:
↳ Replace "import pandas as pd" with "import fireducks.pandas as pd"
↳ The rest of the entire code remains the same. 
↳ So, if you know Pandas, you already know how to use FireDucks.
↳ Done!

2. Ridiculously faster than Pandas, Modin, and Polars. As per official benchmarks:
↳ Modin had an average speed-up of 0.9x over Pandas.
↳ Polars had an average speed-up of 39x over Pandas.
↳ But FireDucks had an average speed-up of 50x over Pandas.

3. Pandas is single-core; FireDucks is multi-core.

4. Pandas follows eager execution; FireDucks is based on lazy execution. This way, FireDucks can build a logical execution plan and apply possible optimizations.

5. That said, even under eager execution, FireDucks is way faster than Pandas, as depicted in the image below.
